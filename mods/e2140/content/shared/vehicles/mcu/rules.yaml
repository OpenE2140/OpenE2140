		Title: MCU (Meta Construction Unit)
		Armor: Thick
		Armament: None
		Description: The MCU is a heavy vehicle which is used to construct all types of structures. However, the type of structure the MCU can construct must first be defined and cannot be changed.\n\nThe MCU is a large, heavy, slow-moving vehicle, which is very difficult to navigate. It does, however, have thick armour-plating, making up for its weaknesses should the enemy launch a small attack. Bear in mind, however, that the MCU is unarmed.
