		Description: Resources are extracted from the depths of a mine. Mines are completely automated and do not require personnel. The extracted ores are placed in containers and transported to a refinery by either a BANTHA or a HEAVY LIFTER. Each container contains resources to the value of 200 Dollars. A mine can only be built in locations containing resources. You cannot build a mine anywhere else. If there are plenty of resources, you may have to build a new mine, if one stops producing. A mine can only extract resources in a certain area. When all the available resources have been extracted the mine shuts down.
