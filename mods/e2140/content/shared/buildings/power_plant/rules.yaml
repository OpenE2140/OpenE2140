		Description: The nuclear power plant is built in modules. Two further modules, each generating 500 energy units, can be added at any time.\n\nThe power plant itself generates 2000 energy units. The nuclear power plant is used to supply structures which are unable to generate energy themselves. Structures which have no energy are not active. They cannot construct anything and their defense systems are unusable.\n\nThe destruction of a nuclear power plant has serious consequences for the direct environment. Due to atomic contamination, any unit which remains in the building for too long will be destroyed. The contamination will overload the generators of most vehicles, eventually destroying them.
		#TODO Price += 500 for each module
		#TODO Energy supplied += 500 energy units per module
