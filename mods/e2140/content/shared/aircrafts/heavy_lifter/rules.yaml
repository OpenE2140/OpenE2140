		# Unforunately there's a bug in Aircraft trait, when the code for granting/revoking airborne condition does not take into account
		# the position offsets. This means that aircraft with non-zero offset (on Z axis) is never considered as landed, which causes issues
		# (like units targeting only ground units not being able to damage this aircraft).
		
		# After the bug is fixed, uncomment LandAltitude value.

		Title: Heavy Lifter - Heavy Air-Transport Unit
		Armor: Medium
		Armament: None
		Description: The Heavy Lifter is a heavy, flying transporter used, (like the BANTHA), to transport raw materials from mine to refinery. Since it can fly it is extremely useful in transporting resources over long distances or mountainous terrain. The Heavy Lifter is very maneuverable, allowing it to be loaded and unloaded quickly.\n\nDespite being expensive and slow, it is very useful in situations where a BANTHA is either very slow or cannot be used at all.
