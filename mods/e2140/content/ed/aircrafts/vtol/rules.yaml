		Title: Vertical Take-Off Flier
		Armor: light
		Armament: heavy rockets
		Description: This unit was sorely missing from the ED's Air Force.\nSmall, fast and heavily-armed, the Vertical Takeoff Flier is ideal for attacking distant targets.\nEquipped with heavy rockets, the Vertical Takeoff Flier is excellent at destroying structures and defence towers.\nBecause of its light armor it is not necessarily suitable for action against massed units.
