		Armor: Medium
		Armament: None
		Description: The HAT is a turbine powered transporter, whose four turbines enable it to quickly reach high altitudes and cover large distances very fast.\n\nHAT can transport up to six A or SILVER units and is heavily armored, unusual for an airborne machine. It is ideal for moving troops, withstanding rocket fire for a relatively long period of time. It is fast enough to maneuver itself out of the line of enemy rocket attacks.
