		Title: THUNDER - Battle Helicopter
		Armor: Light
		Armament: Small rocket launcher
		Description: The THUNDER is based on a technically improved version of the STORM helicopter. It is fitted with a small rocket launcher instead of a machine gun. It can be used on static targets and large vehicles. It is not particularly useful in battles with moving targets such as A series androids or SILVER series battle units. A certain distance from the target is required and the maneuver needed to readjust its position when the target moves makes THUNDER extremely vulnerable.
