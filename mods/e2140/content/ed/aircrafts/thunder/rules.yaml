		Title: THUNDER - Battle Helicopter
		Armor: lite
		Armament: small rocket launcher
		Description: The THUNDER is based on a technically improved version of the STORM helicopter.\nIt is fitted with a small rocket launcher instead of a machine gun.\nIt can be used on static targets and large vehicles.\nIt is not particularly useful in battles with moving targets such as A series androids or SILVER series battle units.\nA certain distance from the target is required and the maneuver needed to readjust its position when the target moves makes THUNDER extremely vulnerable.
