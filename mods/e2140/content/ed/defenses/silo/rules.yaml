		Title: Launcher for Nuclear Rockets
		Armor: Heavy
		Armament: None
		Resistance: High
		Description: The whole apparatus is under ground. Only the gate with heavy armor-plating is above the ground, opening shortly before the launch of a rocket and closing immediately after.\n\nA launcher for nuclear rockets holds only one rocket and cannot be used after the rocket has been launched. With its heavy armor-plating it can still be used to support a defense line.
