		Title: KT 30 - Battleship
		Armor: Heavy
		Armament: Launcher for small and heavy self-guided rockets
		Description: The KT 30 is a medium-sized battleship with heavy armor-plating and heavy weapons. Its disadvantage is its low speed but its heavy armorplating and its two rocket launchers with self-guided missiles, both small and large, make it a force to be reckoned with. The KT 30 can be used to fight hostile ships or buildings that are close to shore. You can use the small rockets against air-attacks. These features gave the KT 30 the nickname “swimming castle”.
