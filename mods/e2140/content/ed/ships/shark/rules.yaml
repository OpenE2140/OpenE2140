		Description: Its high velocity and its torpedoes make the SHARK ideal for quick attacks aimed at destroying enemy marine units. How-ever, SHARK is completely helpless against landbased or air-borne attacks.\n\nA SHARK should avoid direct confrontation and use its speed to get enough distance between itself and the enemy
