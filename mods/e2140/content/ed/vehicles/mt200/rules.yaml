		Title: MT 200 - Middle-sized Tank
		Armor: Medium
		Armament: Heavy cannon
		Description: The MT 200, a medium sized tank, is an excellent weapon. Its large cannon is ideal for eliminating enemy vehicles and structures. It has good armor-plating and, compared to similar tanks, is very fast, making it hard to destroy.\n\nIts aiming mechanism is slow, making it very difficult to combat fast and agile units, like the enemy SILVER series. However, the tank can simply run over and crush enemy units.
