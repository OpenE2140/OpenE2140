		Title: ST 02 - Small Tank
		Armor: lite
		Armament: small rockets
		Description: The ST 02 is a small tank, based on the ST 01B, which is fitted out with a liteweight rocket launcher.\nIt is ideal for launching attacks on small airborne targets and buildings.\nIts liteweight armor, makes it an easy target for the SILVER series battle units.\nIt should be escorted by several A-series androids in this sort of battle.\nJust like the ST 01B, it should not be used in battles with enemy HELL-series battle units, since the armor is easily burned by the DXC-additive in their napalm bombs.
