		Title: HT 30 LR - "Crusher"
		Armor: heavy
		Armament: two laser-guns and small rocket launcher
		Description: HT series tanks are the heavyweights of the battle field.\nThese huge tanks have a highly resistant armor-plating which efficiently protects them from any kind of weapon.\nThe armor has simply everything you could wish for.\nIt has two laser cannons, which are ideal for quickly and efficiently destroying anything, even moving targets and structures.\nDuring the relatively long length of time it takes to reload the generators, it can fire its liteweight rocket launchers.\nYou can use these against air-borne targets.\nThe HT 30 LR is currently the best tank in the world and carries the name "Crusher".\nIts main disadvantage is lack of speed due to its tremendous weight of armor and weaponry.
