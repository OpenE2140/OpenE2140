		Title: HT 33 R - Heavyweight Tank
		Armor: heavy
		Armament: launcher for big rockets
		Description: The HT 33 R is based on the HT 30 and has three additional launchers for large, automatic long-range rockets.\nThis makes the HT 33 R one of the most effective and destructive weapons for use against vehicles, structures and flying targets, even when used at long-distance.\nAll HT series tanks have outstanding armor-plating, which can offer protection for a relatively long period of time against enemy attacks.\nBut again, the weight slows this tank down.
