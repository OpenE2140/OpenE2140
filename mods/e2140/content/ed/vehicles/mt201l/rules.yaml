		Title: MT 201L - Middle-sized Tank
		Armor: Heavy
		Armament: Laser-gun
		Description: The MT 201L, being based on the MT 200, is also a middleweight tank, but is fitted with a laser cannon which is ideal for quickly destroying the enemy's lightweight vehicles. The armor-plating is an improvement on the original version, making it pretty strong. This is a defense plus while the laser cannon generator is reloading. But it's still advisable to have the protection of other units. The laser cannon is effective at close range, making it a good defense weapon if enemy SILVER units launch an attack. You can use this tank to run over and crush enemy units.
