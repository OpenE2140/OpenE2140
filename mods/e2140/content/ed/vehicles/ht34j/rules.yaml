		Title: HT 34J - Heavyweight Tank
		Armor: heavy
		Armament: ion-canon
		Description: The HT 34 J (also based on the HT 30) is equipped with an ion cannon.\nIon technology is the latest Eurasian Dynasty development, which enables them to take-over and use the enemy's war machines.\nThe ion cannon paralyses the electronics of the enemy vehicle, immobilising it.\nThese vehicles can then be repaired and reprogrammed by an HCU-M.\nSo it's advisable to pair the HT 34J with an HCU-M at all times.\nDue to the overly large size of its generators, an HT chassis had to be used for this vehicle, which slows it right down.
