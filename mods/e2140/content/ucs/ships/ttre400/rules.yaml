		Description: The TTR is a fast mine layer which can safeguard territories effectively from enemy ships and submarines by laying and moving water mines.\n\nThe only armament a TTR 400 carries are its mines, making it an easy target for the enemy. Itâ€™s only defense is to retreat, dropping mines in the water as it goes.
