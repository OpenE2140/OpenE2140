		Description: Plasma Blast is the latest UCS invention and currently the best mass destruction device in the world. A very strong plasma laser beam is fired, not to destroy but as a transport medium for large numbers of plasma bombs. Although the Plasma Blast can be fired as often as necessary, it does take a while for the generators to recharge.
