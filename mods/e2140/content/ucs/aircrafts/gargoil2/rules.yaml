		Armor: heavy rockets
		Armament: light
		Description: A better, modernized version of its predecessor, the Gargoil Reconnaissance Plane, the GARGOIL II is ideal for directly attacking structures and individual units.\nEquipped with heavy rockets, this fast, compact fighting machine is a central element of the UCS Air Force.\nHowever, due to its light armor, the GARGOIL II should not be used against massed enemy units.
