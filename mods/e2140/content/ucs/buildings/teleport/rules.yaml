		Description: Teleport makes it possible to take delivery of goods directly from the main underground base. The items to be transported are first dematerialized and then re-materialized in the Teleport. This process not only requires large quantities of energy, it is also very expensive. So vehicles acquired in this way are more expensive than if they were built at the point of delivery. There are many situations which justify this higher price; for example, when the main base is under enemy attack. In this case, it is better to pay the higher price and have the vehicles delivered quickly.
