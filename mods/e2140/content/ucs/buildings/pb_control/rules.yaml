		Title: Plasma Control Center
		Armor: Protected from traditional weapons
		Armament: None
		Resistance: Medium
		Description: This control center is responsible for the entire Plasma Blast, a new UCS invention. The Eurasian Dynasty still uses long distance atomic rockets, whereas the UCS has this new, even more powerful, technology. Plasma Blast is a plasma cannon with a very strong plasma laser beam. You can destroy long distance targets using the plasma laser beam as a transport medium for a large number of plasma bombs.\n\nThis Control Center must be built before stationary Plasma Blasts can be constructed.
