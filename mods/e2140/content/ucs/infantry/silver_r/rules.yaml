		Description: The SILVER R and the SILVER ONE are similarly constructed, the only difference being in their weaponry. SILVER R has a rocket launcher instead of a machine gun. This makes it efficient at destroying static targets and light or middleweight vehicles. The SILVER R can fire smaller rockets in the event of an air-raid. Being is so small and zippy, it is ideal for doing battle with ED helicopters.
