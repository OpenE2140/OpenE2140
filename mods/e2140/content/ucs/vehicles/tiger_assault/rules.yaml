		Title: TIGER Assault
		Armor: Middle and fireproof
		Armament: Two lightweight rocket launchers
		Description: TIGER-type battle robots are middleweight, heavily armored battle machines, mainly used when attacking the enemy. They are still very fast, in spite of all that armor they are still very fast. TIGER-Assault robots with their two lightweight rocket launchers, are true all-round destroyers. They are connected directly to the central computer and have their own built-in new generation artificial intelligence.
