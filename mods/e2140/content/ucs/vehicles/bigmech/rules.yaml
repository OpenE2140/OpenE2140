		Title: BIG MECH
		Armor: Heavy
		Armament: Two light rocket launchers
		Description: At first glance, this heavily armed battle machine doesn't seem very impressively equipped. But rest assured, the BIG MECH is definitely one of the UCS' most impressive weapons. Its two fast-firing light rocket launchers fire 16 rockets in a row and take very little time to load.
