		Title: SPIDER
		Armor: Heavy
		Armament: Two plasma guns
		Description: The SPIDER is a heavy unit with its own artificial intelligence which receives battle commands from the central computers.\n\nThe SPIDER's armor is strengthened with a special alloy, which makes it even more rocket-proof. Armed with two quick-fire plasma guns, it's slower than the TIGER-series, but thanks to those new generation plasma guns it carries, it's great for backing up battle robots, e.g., the TIGER series, when they launch an attack on the enemy.
