		Title: TIGER HellMaker
		Armor: Heavy and bulletproof
		Armament: Two napalm bomb firing devices
		Description: The HellMaker is part of the second generation of TIGER-Series battle robots.\n\nThey have two devices for firing napalm-type bombs which can burn a complete army of small battle units to death within seconds. In combat with a light or middleweight Eurasian Dynasty tank, the DXC additive in the napalm will corrode and burn the tank’s armor.
