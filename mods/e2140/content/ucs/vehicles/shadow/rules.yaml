		Description: The SHADOW is a tracked vehicle with a difference - it has stealth camouflaging.\nFor decades the UCS have been researching vehicle invisibility.\nSHADOW is the result of that research - an improved and fully functional version of the prototype.\nThe new SHADOW's system can camouflage, for example, a middle sized army for any length of time.
