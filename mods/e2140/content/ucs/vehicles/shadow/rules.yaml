		Description: The SHADOW is a tracked vehicle with a difference - it has stealth camouflaging. For decades the UCS have been researching vehicle invisibility. SHADOW is the result of that research - an improved and fully functional version of the prototype.\n\nThe new SHADOW's system can camouflage, for example, a middle sized army for any length of time.
